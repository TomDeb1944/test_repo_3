just adding the note to 3.txt
I am going to add it to staging area
once done, I'm going to add it to commit

once done, I will edit this text file and add it to different commit
tbc.

Ok, so by doing this note I'm editing the file, but going to add to a different commit
expected result? see the note till "tbc" in previous commit, and see the notes done after in different commit
so basically 2 different notes in the same file

overwritten 3.txt in the same commit
doing this note to complete expected result
